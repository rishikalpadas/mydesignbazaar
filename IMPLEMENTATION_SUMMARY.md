# Designer Block/Delete System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds comprehensive functionality for admins to block or delete approved designer accounts, with the following key features:

### Block vs Delete Distinction

| Feature | BLOCK | DELETE |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Account Access | Disabled | Removed |
| Credentials Locked | ✅ Yes (Permanent) | ❌ No |
| Designs Deleted | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Can Re-register | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Email Notification | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Use Case | Policy violations, fraud, permanent bans | Administrative cleanup, user requests |

## Files Created

### 1. Models
- **`src/models/BlockedCredentials.js`** - Tracks blocked credentials (email, phone, Aadhaar, PAN)
  - Indexes for fast credential lookup
  - Static methods for checking and managing blocked credentials

### 2. Services
- **`src/lib/designerManagementService.js`** - Core business logic
  - `blockDesignerAccount()` - Blocks account and adds credentials to blocklist
  - `deleteDesignerAccount()` - Deletes account and removes from blocklist
  - `deleteDesignerDesigns()` - Removes all designer uploads
  - `deleteDesignerFiles()` - Cleans up profile documents
  - `isDesignerBlocked()` - Check block status
  - `getApprovedDesigners()` - Fetch approved designers

- **`src/lib/emailTemplates.js`** - Email notification templates
  - `sendBlockNotificationEmail()` - Notifies designer of account block
  - `sendDeleteNotificationEmail()` - Notifies designer of account deletion

### 3. API Endpoints
- **`src/app/api/admin/designers/block/route.js`**
  - POST endpoint to block designer accounts
  - Requires admin authentication
  - Validates reason is provided
  - Returns deleted designs count

- **`src/app/api/admin/designers/delete/route.js`**
  - DELETE endpoint to delete designer accounts
  - Requires admin authentication
  - Validates reason is provided
  - Allows credential reuse

### 4. Middleware
- **`src/middleware/blockedCredentialsCheck.js`**
  - `checkBlockedCredentials()` - Checks if credentials are blocked
  - `validateRegistrationCredentials()` - Validates before registration
  - Automatically blocks registration attempts with blocked credentials

### 5. UI Components
- **`src/components/dashboard/BlockDeleteDesignerModal.jsx`**
  - Reusable modal for block/delete actions
  - Supports both block and delete modes
  - Requires reason input (minimum 10 characters)
  - Shows clear warnings about consequences
  - Handles loading and error states

### 6. Documentation
- **`REGISTRATION_UPDATE_INSTRUCTIONS.md`** - How to update registration route
- **`DESIGNERS_PAGE_UPDATE_INSTRUCTIONS.md`** - How to add UI controls
- **`IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`** - This file

## Required Manual Updates

Due to file sync issues, you'll need to manually update these files:

### 1. Update Designer Schema
**File:** `src/models/User.js`

Add these fields to the `designerSchema` (around line 128, after `totalEarnings`):

```javascript
// Account Status
accountStatus: {
  type: String,
  enum: ['active', 'blocked', 'deleted'],
  default: 'active',
},
blockedAt: Date,
blockedBy: {
  type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
  ref: 'User',
},
blockReason: String,
deletedAt: Date,
deletedBy: {
  type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
  ref: 'User',
},
deleteReason: String,
```

### 2. Update Registration Route
**File:** `src/app/api/auth/register/route.js`

Follow instructions in `REGISTRATION_UPDATE_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

### 3. Update Designers Dashboard Page
**File:** `src/app/dashboard/designers/page.js`

Follow instructions in `DESIGNERS_PAGE_UPDATE_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

## System Flow

### Block Flow
```
Admin clicks "Block" → Modal opens → Admin enters reason → Confirm
  ↓
Block API called
  ↓
Designer account status set to 'blocked'
  ↓
Credentials added to BlockedCredentials collection
  ↓
All designs deleted from filesystem and database
  ↓
Email sent to designer with block reason
  ↓
Designer list refreshed
```

### Delete Flow
```
Admin clicks "Delete" → Modal opens → Admin enters reason → Confirm
  ↓
Delete API called
  ↓
Credentials removed from BlockedCredentials (if present)
  ↓
All designs deleted from filesystem and database
  ↓
Designer profile files deleted (Aadhaar, PAN, samples)
  ↓
Designer profile deleted from database
  ↓
User account deleted from database
  ↓
Email sent to designer with deletion reason
  ↓
Designer list refreshed
```

### Registration Prevention Flow
```
Designer attempts registration
  ↓
System checks if email/phone/Aadhaar/PAN are in BlockedCredentials
  ↓
If blocked:
  - Return 403 error
  - Show "Account Blocked" message
  - Prevent registration
If not blocked:
  - Allow registration to proceed normally
```

## Email Notifications

### Block Email
- Subject: "Account Blocked - MyDesignBazaar"
- Contains: Reason, list of blocked credentials, consequences, appeal instructions
- Tone: Formal, informative

### Delete Email
- Subject: "Account Deleted - MyDesignBazaar"
- Contains: Reason, list of removed data, ability to re-register
- Tone: Professional, neutral

## Database Collections

### BlockedCredentials Collection
```javascript
{
  email: String (indexed),
  phoneNumber: String (indexed),
  aadhaarNumber: String (indexed),
  panNumber: String (indexed),
  blockedBy: ObjectId,
  blockReason: String,
  originalUserId: ObjectId,
  blockedAt: Date,
  metadata: {
    adminEmail: String,
    adminName: String,
    designerName: String,
    ipAddress: String
  }
}
```

### Designer Schema Updates
```javascript
{
  // ... existing fields ...
  accountStatus: 'active' | 'blocked' | 'deleted',
  blockedAt: Date,
  blockedBy: ObjectId,
  blockReason: String,
  deletedAt: Date,
  deletedBy: ObjectId,
  deleteReason: String
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: All admin endpoints require authentication via `withAuth` middleware
2. **Validation**: Reason is required and must be at least 10 characters
3. **Audit Trail**: All actions logged with admin info, timestamps, reasons
4. **File Cleanup**: Files are securely deleted from filesystem
5. **Credential Locking**: Blocked credentials are indexed for fast lookup
6. **Email Notifications**: Users are always notified of account actions

## API Usage Examples

### Block a Designer

Headers: {
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
  "Cookie": "admin-session-token"
}
Body: {
  "userId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",

}

Response: {
  "success": true,
  "message": "Designer account blocked successfully",
  "deletedDesignsCount": 15
}
```

```javascript
DELETE /api/admin/designers/delete
Headers: {
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
  "Cookie": "admin-session-token"
}
Body: {
  "userId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
  "deleteReason": "Designer requested account deletion via support ticket #1234"
}

Response: {
  "success": true,
  "message": "Designer account deleted successfully",
  "deletedDesignsCount": 15
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: File sync errors during implementation
**Solution**: Use the instruction files to manually update the affected files

### Issue: Email not sending
**Solution**:
- Check EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD in .env
- Ensure Gmail has "Less secure app access" enabled or use App Password
- Check nodemailer logs

### Issue: Blocked credentials not preventing registration
**Solution**:
- Ensure registration route is updated per instructions
- Check MongoDB connection
- Verify BlockedCredentials collection exists

### Issue: Designs not being deleted
**Solution**:
- Check file paths match your upload structure
- Verify permissions on uploads directory
- Check Design model has correct schema

## Future Enhancements

1. **Audit Log**: Create comprehensive admin action log
2. **Appeal System**: Allow designers to appeal blocks
3. **Temporary Suspensions**: Add time-limited suspensions
4. **Batch Operations**: Block/delete multiple designers at once
5. **Export Data**: Allow export of designer data before deletion
6. **Soft Delete**: Implement soft delete with recovery period
7. **Block Levels**: Different severity levels of blocks
8. **Notification Center**: In-app notifications for designers
