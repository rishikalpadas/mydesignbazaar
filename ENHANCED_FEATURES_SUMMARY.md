## How It Works Now

### Blocking Flow (Enhanced):
```
Admin clicks Block → Modal opens → Enter reason → Confirm
  ↓
Block API called
  ↓
Designer account status = 'blocked'
  ↓
ALL credentials saved to BlockedCredentials:
  - Email, Phone, Alt Phone
  - Aadhaar, PAN, GST
  - Bank Account, UPI, PayPal
  - Portfolio Links
  ↓
Designs deleted
  ↓
Email sent listing ALL blocked credentials
  ↓
List refreshed
```

### Unblocking Flow (NEW):
```
Admin clicks Unblock → Enters reason → Confirm
  ↓
Unblock API called
  ↓
Designer account status = 'active'
  ↓
Remove credentials from BlockedCredentials
  ↓
Designer can login and upload again
  ↓
List refreshed
```

### Registration Prevention (Enhanced):
```
Designer tries to register
  ↓
System checks BlockedCredentials for:
  - Email match? BLOCKED
  - Phone match? BLOCKED
  - Alt phone match? BLOCKED
  - Aadhaar match? BLOCKED
  - PAN match? BLOCKED
  - GST match? BLOCKED
  - Bank account match? BLOCKED
  - UPI ID match? BLOCKED
  - PayPal ID match? BLOCKED
  - Portfolio link match? BLOCKED
  ↓
If ANY match found → Registration rejected with 403 error
If NO match → Registration proceeds normally
```
